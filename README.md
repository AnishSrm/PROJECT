# FitBit Game App #

## Overview ##
Steppy Giuseppe is a platformer video game that is based in the edu-tainment genre.
Players connect their fitbit device and fitbit account to the game and trade in their step count for ingame currency
known as ‘Stepcoins’. The purpose of this game is to educate young children about eating healthy and exercising in an
entertaining way. These in-game stepcoins can be traded in the game to level up attributes such as 
speed or jump height. As the player buys more of these attributes, they are able to progress
through harder levels.\
\
Users can log into the application using their Fitbit credentials to retrieve daily step activity that
is used for the progression of the game. Those steps will directly be added to their current stepcoin currency in the game.
